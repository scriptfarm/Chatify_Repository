# Chatify_Repository
This application is a chat program for Group Chat / Video Chat / Voice Chat that is fully encrypted with a custom implementation of 
sending images and other files.

If you request the Android Smartphone implementation, I am happy to help you out since I have started working on it.

## Installation
1. Download or clone the application
2. Install Java 7
3. Setup MySql database and set the correct configurations in the application
4. Run the Server instance of the program
5. Run the Client instance of the program and connect to the server

## Usage
Set the correct IP Address for the server and login with the username of your choice. You can create groups with all the other hosts
online and communicate fully encrypted. You can also make peer to peer video and voice calls. Furthermore you can send images of certain
MIME-types to other hosts which then can be saved.
